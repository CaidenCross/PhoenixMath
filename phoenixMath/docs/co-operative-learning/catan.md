#### Standards

CCSS 6.EE.A.2      
Write, read, and evaluate expressions in which letters stand for numbers.  

CCSS 6.EE.A.2a   
Write expressions that record operations with numbers and with letters standing for numbers. For example, express the calculation ‚ÄúSubtract ùò∫ from 5‚Äù as 5 - ùò∫.  

CCSS 6.EE.B.6  
Use variables to represent numbers and write expressions when solving a real-world or mathematical problem; understand that a variable can represent an unknown number, or, depending on the purpose at hand, any number in a specified set.  

CCSS 6.EE.B.7  
Solve real-world and mathematical problems by writing and solving equations of the form ùòπ + ùò± = ùò≤ and ùò±ùòπ = ùò≤ for cases in which ùò±, ùò≤ and ùòπ are all nonnegative rational numbers.  

CCSS 7.EE.B.4  
Use variables to represent quantities in a real-world or mathematical problem, and construct simple equations and inequalities to solve problems by reasoning about the quantities.

Included:
*Color as well as Black and White versions
*Resource Cards - Hammer, Wood, Brick, Construction Hat and Nails
*House Cards - Window, Door, Roof and Walls
*Student Rules (2 versions based on game play)
*How to Build Student Cheat Sheets
*Teacher Explanations

Types of Problems:
*Hammer - Area of Squares, Rectangles, Triangles, Trapezoids, Parallelograms and Kites.
*Wood - Volume of Cubes, Rectangular Prisms, Triangular Prisms, Cylinders, Rectangular Pyramids and Triangular Pyramids.
*Brick - Surface Area of Cubes, Rectangular Prisms, Triangular Prisms and Trapezoidal Prisms.
*Construction Hat - Nets with and without Surface Area of Cubes, Rectangular Prisms, Triangular Prisms, Trapezoidal Prisms, Cylinders, Rectangular Pyramids and Triangular Pyramids
